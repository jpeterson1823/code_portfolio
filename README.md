# John Peterson's Code Portfolio

## Contents

This repository serves as a working portfolio of all my "mini-projects" or practice that don't have the complexity
that would require their own repo.

## TODO

* Add more substantial stuff to this README
* Reorganize files/projects within this repo to make it easier to follow
  - Remove any old/dead mini-projects that:
    * a) I don't plan to work on in the future
      - *especially* projects that are of the spaghetti variety
    * b) I don't plan to use in the future
    * c) I don't like the structure of the project
